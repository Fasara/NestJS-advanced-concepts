## Schematics

A schematic is a template-based generator that is a set of instructions for transforming a software project by generating or modifying code.

We can utilize these schematics to enforce architectural rules and conventions, making our project consistent and inter-operative. Or we could create schematics to help us generate commonly-used code - shared services, modules, interfaces, health checks, docker files, etc.

For more real-world example, with the help of schematics we could reduce the amount of time we might need to setup all the boilerplate for creating a new microservice within our organization by creating a microservice schematic that generates all of the common code / loggers / tools / etc that we might commonly use in our organizations microservices.
